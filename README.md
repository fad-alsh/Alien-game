Help! The Aliens are here! Save the world!

On a really hot summer day I decided to program this little arcade game that reminds me some of the games I used to play on my dad's old phone when I was a child. I know..it's not that special but I mean, it's my first!

## How to play

Clone it into your terminal and install pygame:

    git clone https://github.com/fad-alsh/Alien-game.git
    pip install pygame
    
Enter and run it:

    cd alien-game/alien_shooting
    python game.py 

Enjoy!ðŸ™‚ðŸŽ®
